Not only has the number of cyberattacks increased significantly over the last few decades, but they have also become more sophisticated. As a result, developing a cyber-resilient strategy is critical. Traditional security methods are insufficient to prevent data breaches in the event of a cyberattack.
Cybercriminals have learned how to hack, attack, and breach data using new techniques and powerful tools. Fortunately, AI technologies have been introduced into cyberspace to build smart models for defending systems from attacks.

AI technologies can be used as fundamental tools in the field of cybersecurity because they can rapidly evolve to address complex situations. AI-based techniques have the potential to provide efficient and powerful cyber defense tools for detecting malware attacks, network intrusions, phishing and spam emails, and data breaches, 

## What is AI and How does it work

Artificial intelligence is a technology that enables machines and computer applications to mimic human intellect by learning from experience through iterative processing and algorithmic training.

AI systems learn from patterns and features in the data that they study by combining massive amounts of data with sophisticated, iterative processing algorithms. Each time an AI system runs a round of data processing, it tests and measures its own performance and develops additional expertise.

Because AI never requires a break, it can run through hundreds, thousands, or even millions of jobs extraordinarily fast, learning a significant lot in a short period of time and becoming extremely proficient at whatever it's being trained to do.





## Taditional Security Approaches and their disadvantages

Traditional cybersecurity methods rely on the static control of security devices and work in response to an attack. For instance, the majority of intrusion detection systems currently in use completely rely on a predefined set of Rules or patterns to monitor, detect, and provide alerts for intrusions. However, there is a significant disadvantage to that strategy. For instance, one disadvantage is that attackers can get around static rules or patterns by using different attack obfuscations techniques.

Many of these IDS and IPS, Firewalls, and WAFS use regex-based rules or patterns to detect, prevent, block, and alert security incidents. In fact, Using Regex based Security measures plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of security posture across multiple layers of a corporation's infrastructure. For example, Network Security Engineers use regex to fine-tune how firewalls behave, Developers use regex to do input validation, System administrators can use regex rules to detect potentially dangerous content in files and to quarantine these files accordingly.

Because regex is so widely used as a security measure, incorrectly deployed regex patterns can have a wide-ranging impact on a effected orginisation. However, because we are completely relying on a simple regex to delete and alert the intrusion and not using any active technology to actively analyze the behavior of the attack and then take active decisions to block and prevent it.

It again subjugates it to many bypasses, and Attacker can simply get around static rules or patterns by using different attack obfuscations techniques.


## AI in Cybersecurity 

AI, as an example, adopts intelligence and can perform real-time analysis and decision making while processing enormous amounts of data to solve problems. AI can analyze large amount of data efficiently, accurately, and in short time. Using threats history, an AI-based system can know about the past threats and use this knowledge to predict similar attacks in the future, even if their patterns change.
