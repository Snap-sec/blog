According to Security Researchers every code upadate/push to your production server or application may bring new Vulnerabilities in action. Because everytime a code on the server change, It makes changes to Application logic, Tech Stack , Dependencies and may bring infrastructural changes to the network where application are hosted. And it has been know that a average company pushes code to their github/product (DOZEN of time) a day/week/month. Now if thats the case doent it mean you maybe introducing new vulnerabilities with every code push on your server? Maybe yes, maybe not, How to make sure ? Introducing Continiou security model which ensures the security of your products or network no matter how many times you push code to the server.

## What is Continuios Security Model

We believe Traditional Penetration testing is not enough to make sure that your system are safe against online threats, Large application estates, or applications that are changing often, provide challenges for traditional pen testing. Itâ€™s just not resonable to perform few pentests year and believe to be safe against online attacks. While introducing new vulnerabilities in your application every single day by either pushing new code to the production or making any changes to the provious one. So, A new approach is needed that delivers continues security testing solution with the ability to scale. That's why we believe in Continue Security Testing. Our Continuous Security Testing (CST) service gives you visibility of potential vulnerabilities, across your infrastructure, 365 days a year. 


## How does it work 

Let's make this as simple as we can, Imagine you own or you are responsible for managing an security of `catstore.com`.

### Traditional Pentesting__:

One of the Easiest and simplest way to Ensure you product is vulnerability free is to perform an Penetration test on your application, In which are group of specialised individuals Will try to attack your application to find any possible vulnerabilities which would allow them to compromise the companies or your user information. Not this seems to be a very simplified version of making sure your product is safe but as soon as you update or change or push code on your production  server you are back to the point where you will be completely doubtful if your application is full security or not.

### Continiou Security testing__

Now imagine and second scenario where your product is tested every week exactly in the same manner it's used to be tested once a year and you are made aware about the new potential vulnerabilities that have arised by updating or changing code to the production servers throug the weekly Highly summarized report of your product and which would include the different type of attacks and test-case that your application had to go through. This brings your following good things to the table:

- __Continues surveillance__:

With the help of cloud computing and advance fast scanners and Automation Attackers have evolved their ways to scan and exploit new target systems, and the fact modern application development has more development cycles. A single penetration makes no sense to make make sure if , whilst Continuous Security Testing allows for constant scanning for all emerging threats, as well as identification of any weaknesses introduced through code changes.


- __Indepth Security Assesments__: 

In an traditional pentest its hard for the pentesters to dive deep and do the indepth analysis the application logic, But in continues security model the researchers who perform the pentest are re-testing your application twice or thrice a week hence it allows them to take some time and get a good understanding of target application and target [the Business Logic of the application](https://snapsec.co/blog/Business-logic-issues/).
