As a cybersecurity and penetration testing company, it is important for us to have a clear and thorough methodology in place to ensure the effectiveness and reliability of our services. In this article, we will discuss our approach to penetration testing and the tools and techniques we use to identify and address vulnerabilities in our clients' systems and networks. We will also address the role of automation in our testing process and the importance of manual analysis in ensuring the thoroughness of our testing. By understanding our methodology, clients can have confidence in the reliability of our findings and recommendations for improving their cybersecurity posture.




## The Mindset

Having the right mindset is crucial in any field, as it can greatly influence your approach and attitude towards tasks and challenges. In the field of cybersecurity and penetration testing, having the right mindset is especially important, as it can determine how effective you are at identifying and addressing vulnerabilities.

A system is typically made up of three main components: a tech stack, a code base, and the logic of the system.

The tech stack refers to the underlying technologies and infrastructure that support the system. This can include things like the operating system, web server, database, and programming languages.

The code base refers to the actual source code of the system, including any custom scripts or libraries.

The logic of the system refers to the business processes and rules that the system is designed to implement.

Each of these components can have its own set of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. For example, the tech stack may have vulnerabilities in the operating system or web server that can be exploited. The code base may have vulnerabilities due to poor coding practices or the use of outdated libraries. The logic of the system may have vulnerabilities due to flaws in the way that business processes are implemented.

To ensure that a system is secure, We at Snapsec test all three aspects of the system: the tech stack, the code base, and the logic of the system. 

This includes looking for mis-configurations and issues and finding unpatched and misconfigured services and components in the tech stack. We also test the tech stack by using tools to scan for vulnerabilities in the technologies that are being used.

We also test the code base by reviewing the code manually or using automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities. This can include things like looking for SQL injection attacks, buffer overflows, and other types of vulnerabilities.

We also spend in numerous amount of time in learning the workflows and the business logic of the target system and then use of understanding of the system to bypass those workflows to produce a malicious behaviour in the system and finally try to escalate that to security venerability that can be used against the system.
