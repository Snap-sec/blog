As a cybersecurity and penetration testing company, it is important for us to have a clear and thorough methodology in place to ensure the effectiveness and reliability of our services. In this article, we will discuss our approach to penetration testing and the tools and techniques we use to identify and address vulnerabilities in our clients' systems and networks. We will also address the role of automation in our testing process and the importance of manual analysis in ensuring the thoroughness of our testing. By understanding our methodology, clients can have confidence in the reliability of our findings and recommendations for improving their cybersecurity posture.




## The Mindset

Having the right mindset is crucial in any field, as it can greatly influence your approach and attitude towards tasks and challenges. In the field of cybersecurity and penetration testing, having the right mindset is especially important, as it can determine how effective you are at identifying and addressing vulnerabilities.

A system is typically made up of three main components: a tech stack, a code base, and the logic of the system.

The tech stack refers to the underlying technologies and infrastructure that support the system. This can include things like the operating system, web server, database, and programming languages.

The code base refers to the actual source code of the system, including any custom scripts or libraries.

The logic of the system refers to the business processes and rules that the system is designed to implement.

Each of these components can have its own set of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. For example, the tech stack may have vulnerabilities in the operating system or web server that can be exploited. The code base may have vulnerabilities due to poor coding practices or the use of outdated libraries. The logic of the system may have vulnerabilities due to flaws in the way that business processes are implemented.

To ensure that a system is secure, We at Snapsec test all three aspects of the system: the tech stack, the code base, and the logic of the system. 

This includes looking for mis-configurations and issues and finding unpatched and misconfigured services and components in the tech stack. We also test the tech stack by using tools to scan for vulnerabilities in the technologies that are being used.

We also test the code base by reviewing the code manually or using automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities. This can include things like looking for SQL injection attacks, buffer overflows, and other types of vulnerabilities.

We also spend in numerous amount of time in learning the workflows and the business logic of the target system and then use of understanding of the system to bypass those workflows to produce a malicious behaviour in the system and finally try to escalate that to security venerability that can be used against the system.


## What type of issues do we Look for ?

The types of security vulnerabilities that are looked for during a penetration test can vary depending on the asset being tested. For example, if the asset being tested is a web application, a list of relevant web application vulnerabilities will be targeted. These may include vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and insecure direct object references.

If the asset being tested is an Android app, a different set of relevant vulnerabilities will be targeted. These may include vulnerabilities such as insecure data storage, insecure communication, and inadequate cryptography.

It is important to note that the list of vulnerabilities that are targeted during a penetration test can differ from asset to asset, and may also vary depending on the specific goals and objectives of the test.


**INJECTION ATTACKS:** Injection attacks involve injecting malicious code or commands into a system or application in order to execute unintended actions. These attacks can be difficult to detect and can have serious consequences, such as data loss or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**BROKEN AUTHENTICATION AND SESSION MANAGEMENT:** This refers to vulnerabilities in the way that a system or application handles authentication (verifying the identity of users) and session management (maintaining a user's authenticated state). If these processes are not implemented securely, it can leave the system open to attack.

**SERVER SECURITY MISCONFIGURATION:** This refers to servers that have not been configured correctly, which can leave them vulnerable to attack. Common security misconfigurations include open ports, insecurely configured services, and outdated software.

**UNPATCHED SERVICE:** This refers to software or services that are not kept up to date with the latest security patches. Outdated software can contain known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.

**INSUFFICIENT SECURITY CONFIGURABILITY:** This refers to systems or applications that do not allow sufficient control over security settings, which can leave them vulnerable to attack.

**CLIENT SIDE VULNERABILITIES (XSS, CSRF, CORS MISCONFIGURATIONS ETC):** These types of vulnerabilities refer to weaknesses on the client side (e.g. the user's web browser) that can be exploited by attackers. Examples include cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and misconfigured cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).


**BUSINESS LOGIC ISSUES:** This refers to vulnerabilities in the way that a system or application handles business processes and rules. These vulnerabilities can allow attackers to bypass security controls or manipulate data in unintended ways.

**INFRASTRUCTURAL ISSUES (HTTP REQUEST SMUGGLING, CACHE DECEPTION ETC):** These types of vulnerabilities refer to weaknesses in the infrastructure (e.g. network devices, servers, etc.) that support a system or application. Examples include HTTP request smuggling and cache deception.

**FILE UPLOAD VULNERABILITIES:** These types of vulnerabilities refer to weaknesses in the way that a system or application handles file uploads, which can allow attackers to execute malicious code or gain unauthorized access.

**PRIVACY VIOLATION ISSUES:** This refers to vulnerabilities that can allow attackers to access or misuse sensitive personal information.

**INSECURE RANDOMNESS ISSUES:** This refers to weaknesses in the way that a system or application generates random numbers or strings, which can leave it vulnerable to attack.

**CRYPTOGRAPHIC ISSUES:** This refers to vulnerabilities in the way that a system or application implements cryptography, which can leave it vulnerable to attack.

**DEFAULT MISCONFIGURATION ISSUES:** This refers to systems or applications that have not been properly configured, which can leave them vulnerable to attack.

**PRIVILEGE ESCALATION ISSUES:** This refers to vulnerabilities that allow attackers to gain unauthorized

**DEFAULT CREDENTIALS ISSUES:** This refers to the use of default or easily guessable credentials (e.g. "admin" as the username and "password" as the password) for accessing systems or applications. This can be a security issue because it makes it easy for attackers to gain unauthorized access.



## What kind of tools do we use for testing?

Tools used for identifying vulnerabilities can vary depending on the type of asset being tested. For web applications, tools such as Burp Suite, SQLmap, Metasploit, FFUF, Dirseach, Nuclei, nessus, Amass and a tons of Burpsuite plugins are commonly used to identify vulnerabilities. 

While as for testing the security of Mobile applications, tools such as APKtool, Drozer, Burp Proxy, MobSF and Android Studio are to be used. 

Other tools that may be used for identifying vulnerabilities in different types of assets include:

Network scanners and analyzers: These tools are used to scan networks and identify vulnerabilities in network infrastructure. Examples include Nmap and Wireshark.

Vulnerability scanners: These tools are used to scan systems and applications for known vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for addressing them. Examples include Nessus and Qualys and Nuclei by @projectdiscovery.

Ultimately, the choice of tools used for identifying vulnerabilities will depend on the specific needs and characteristics of the asset being tested, as well as the preferences and expertise of the testers.
