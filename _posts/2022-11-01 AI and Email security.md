Cyber threats and SOC overloaded can be unbearable. Adding advanced Artificial Intelligence into the mix can be a real difference-maker. Advanced threats are coming from every direction. The only way to stop these threats is through  integrated use of AI in security.

# Importance of AI in email security.

The need for cybersecurity response teams today is greater than ever. SOC teams are under extreme pressure to identify and address threats as there is more data to secure and threats are coming from all sides. With respect to email security a set of rules controlled which messages entered the inbox and which were droopped or flagged. However, most emails these days are stored in the cloud. For many vendors, the rules-based protection is still in place but rules no longer hold true.

 Instead, artificial intelligence-based email security is required (AI). Traditional solutions overlook as many as 51% of modern threats when there is no advanced AI present. Additionally, without AI, it would be impossible to detect more threats without receiving a deluge of false positives. Rules are time-consuming, ineffective, and impossible to enforce consistently. The greatest method for fending off the always growing cyber threats is to use artificial intelligence (AI). Real intelligence analyses data and makes decisions with a human-like level of intelligence, outperforming humans in both speed and accuracy. 

Additionally, artificial intelligence can assist us in analysing larger and more complicated data sets at an unbeatable rate compared to human evaluations.
# How AI impacts email security

Phishing is, at the core, a cognitive attack. It attacks vulnerable humans with messages and visuals. Of course, humans can be trained to spot and stop phishing, and indeed, training is an integral part of any cybersecurity program. But Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are the only technologies that provide a cognitive-like behavior and adapt and learn. It’s easy to say that Artificial Intelligence can solve all your problems. Indeed, many companies come out and say just that. You’ll see things such as Unsupervised Machine Learning or AI Email Security. Of course, artificial intelligence is many things. But by using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing and image recognition, AI is the technology best able to identify phishing attacks at an accuracy that matches the best analysts. Applying artificial intelligence as the integral part of  email security can be a game changer. The real-world influence of AI is significant when it is taught on a large data set. Artificial intelligence's power stems from its ability to spot previously unnoticed patterns in data. AI which is fed the proper data allows for detections of security events that no human can match, which can significantly redure the spam and phishing emails reaching the inbox. Without AI, it is not humanly possible to keep up with the threat landscape, regardless of the size of your organization.

Your SOC's job will be simpler and more pleasurable with the help of artificial intelligence, which can free up time and mental space. AI also has the potential to lessen risks and improve attack landscape visibility. It is not a magic solution but the phishing issues may be resolved when AI is integrated into everything you do—advanced protection, improved reaction capabilities, and better training. 

AI must be trained on the best data set in order to function efficiently. It must be integrated via API with the cloud suite for email security. The data set of cloud email security solutions is substantially richer once incorporated. The AI can be customised with various indicators of attacks, which include phishing, spam emails etc.

As email continues to migrate to the cloud, and as the market continues to shift away from SEGs towards inline API security, leveraging that positioning by training AI on the most sophisticated attacks is the best way forward.

## Filtering spam emails using AI

**Case-Based Spam Filtering**

The case-based or sample-based spam filtering system is one of the most used and accepted machine learning techniques for spam detection. There are many phases to this type of filtering with the aid of the collection method; it collects data (mails) during the first step. After that, the major transition continues with the preprocessing steps through the client graphical user interface, outlining abstraction, and choice of email data classification, testing the entire process using
vector expression and classifying the data into two classes:
spam and legitimate email.

Finally, the machine learning technique is extended to
training sets and test sets to determine whether this is an
email. The final decision is made through two steps:
 self observation and classifier’s result, deciding whether the
email is spam or legitimate.

## Conclusion

Phishing and other email security flaws are  evolving every year. Existing security systems will continue to have loopholes that hackers can exploit. They will keep developing fresh and inventive strategies to get over this security and access the inbox. And once they get into the inbox, they find unique and sophisticated ways to get the user to click and enter the information they’re looking for.  But the opportunity lies in exploring the potential of the AI in the email security, security industry should come with innovative ways integrating AI that will help organizations defend and safe guard their inboxes.
