You might think great businesses are more under threat of data breaches and cybercriminals attack them more than small businesses. They do, but that’s not the case every time. 

Savvy tech hackers know no boundaries. When it comes to making a profit, they can breach the firewall of your personal security system and hack every folder of it. Unless they are not paid for what they are doing, they might not take huge risks in peeking through systems. Of course, a sum of a huge amount is enough to lure either cyber criminals or any other accuser.  

Contrary to people’s belief, small business owners are more likely prone to get cyber-attacks than any other service in the souks. [Verizon’s Data Breach Investigation Report 2020 (DBIR](https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/)) shows that every one in three data breaches involved a small business. The facts and figures are intriguing as the breaches are not just limited to the United States businesses but business owners across the globe are affected by this threat.

## **How do cybercriminals attack?** 
Cybercriminals seek several vulnerabilities to reach the destination in a system they want to take into control. Some of the common attacks that small businesses are exposed through applications, software, data, and network include:

- **Malware** – They are malicious software such as Trojan horses, spyware, keyloggers, and viruses.
- **Phishing Attacks** – Misleading emails and messages in order to gain sensitive information like social security numbers, passwords, and credit card numbers. 
- **Social Engineering** – When important information is given over phone calls or online.
- **Insider threat** – When a former employee disrupts internal security by sharing or accessing sensitive information. 
- **Ransomware** – A specific malware type that encrypts your data making it inaccessible until the ransom is paid. 
- **Consistent threat** – When a virus enters the system, it remains undetected until it extracts data for money or any other benefit.
## **What do the statistics reveal?** 
A 1000 US-based business owners were involved in a survey back in April, which showed 9 percent of business owners accepted that their businesses were attacked by cybercriminals. On conducting deep research it revealed that 50% of the small business faced at least one common cyber-attack. 

Additionally, it was surprising for [National Commission to know that 68%](https://www.nationwide.com/business/solutions-center/cybersecurity/train-employees#:~:text=Methodology-,Nationwide%20commissioned%20Edelman%20Intelligence%20to%20conduct%20a%2020%2Dminute%2C%20online,partial%20owner%20of%20their%20business.) of the businesses didn’t have a substantial resource for combating cyberattacks.

According to a report shared [by FireEye and Marsh & McLennan Companies](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/13/local-businesses-a-target-for-next-cyberattacks.html) that typically, businesses take around 146 days to identify a cyberattack to their systems. The damage could be imagined in that huge period of time.  

## **5 reasons why hackers are attracted to hacking small businesses?** 
1. ### **They possess extensive data** 
As said, cybercriminals know no boundaries. If they can catch large fish from the pool, phishing on small ones is not a difficult task for them. Tech offenders know that small businesses have loads of data that would be easy to offload from their website and make a good profit selling them to the Dark Web. This data may include property or business information, medical records, emails, contacts, and other useful information.
1. ### **Way to reach larger companies** 
` `In today’s world, businesses are digitally associated with each other. They need one another to manage the supply chain, perform transactions, and share information. While a large number of huge businesses invest in preventing their systems from hacking, penetrating through small business to get into systems of large businesses is less tough than attacking them directly. 
1. ### **Easy to breach security** 
Since enterprise businesses set up an entire team of security professionals to handle the security tasks. But many times the person involves in managing the security wears many caps while performing the business operations. 
1. ### **Inadequate training for cyber security**
Small businesses remain occupied in expanding and managing the businesses. Sadly, they don’t often educate, train or supervise their employees regarding cyber security. 

The negligence, however, leads to making the business vulnerable to cyber-attacks and ultimately they have to pay a huge cost of being busy. Although, [95% of the cyber-attacks](v) occur because of human error. 
1. ### **Insignificant security for employees working from home** 
According to research conducted in the financial year 2020, there was a 600% surge in the cyberattacks associated with COVID-19. Moreover, 40% of the companies that provided work from home facilities to their workers reported an escalation in the cyber hits. 
## **Ways to protect your business from tech hackers?** 
No matter how much you think that your company or business is insignificant to the cyber attackers, you never get to know what kind of data they want to suck up from your website or to what business they will reach through your domain. Plus, it is also unimaginable what they are going to do with this data and the amount they would be making out of it. 

But don’t worry that’s not the end of the story. There are some essential ways that you can opt to prevent your website from hackers and on the same side, you will have peace of mind. These steps include (but are not limited to):

- Performing a background check before employing the employees to make sure that they don’t have a history of cyber crimes 
- Educating employees of the firm to apply specific protocols while opening files or sending attachments with important information 
- Creating a backup for the sensitive data so in the event of cyberattacks, the lost information can be recovered. 
- Make sure that all the systems and software attached to your business are completely protected and updated with compatible firewall and antivirus programs. 
- Insuring your business with cyber liability insurance for your business security solutions. 
## **Endnote:** 
Small businesses who are turning their heads to security and managing their operation on a shoestring budget, may don’t need to have all the above securities in place. While proactive measures may feel daunting but the basics is the place to start with. With consistency and planning, any business can safely reach a robust foundation, which aids in growing the business safely.
