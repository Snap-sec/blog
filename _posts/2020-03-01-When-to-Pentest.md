Organizations use penetration testing, also known as "pen testing" or "ethical hacking," as a crucial security measure to find and fix holes in their systems and networks. To identify and prioritise vulnerabilities that need to be fixed, penetration testing simulates a real-world attack scenario. Organizations can strengthen their overall security posture and lower their risk of a successful cyberattack by performing penetration tests on a regular basis.

Depending on the risk profile of the organisation, the importance of the systems being tested, and regulatory requirements, penetration testing frequency will change. Penetration testing may be required more frequently for businesses in high-risk sectors like finance or healthcare than for businesses in low-risk sectors. In a similar vein, networks and systems that house private or sensitive data, like financial or personal information, may require more testing than others.

The introduction of new systems or networks is one of the most crucial factors to take into account when determining the best time to conduct penetration testing. Vulnerabilities should be checked as soon as a new system or network is put into use. This is crucial because newly created systems and networks are frequently more susceptible to attack than older ones are, and attackers are less likely to take advantage of vulnerabilities that have already been identified and fixed.

When making significant changes to existing systems or networks is another crucial time to conduct penetration testing. This may involve the introduction of new software, hardware upgrades, and adjustments to network configurations. It is crucial to test systems and networks both before and after changes are made in order to ensure that vulnerabilities are found and fixed as soon as possible. These changes have the potential to introduce new vulnerabilities or exacerbate existing ones.

Penetration testing should be conducted after security incidents or breaches in addition to routine testing. Testing of systems and networks that were specifically affected by the incident as well as testing of systems and networks that were not directly affected but may have been impacted can be included in this. This kind of testing can assist organisations in determining the incident's underlying cause and in taking action to stop similar incidents from happening in the future.


Another crucial factor to take into account when deciding whether to conduct penetration testing is regulatory compliance. Penetration testing is subject to a number of industry-specific regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for healthcare organisations and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for companies that process credit card payments. Organizations that operate in these industries are required to comply with these requirements in order to avoid penalties or fines. Typically, these requirements specify how frequently penetration testing must be performed.

It's also crucial to remember that only security experts with experience and credentials who are also familiar with ethical hacking should perform penetration tests. The system owner should have given the testers permission before they conduct the test, and they should be aware of the ethical and legal ramifications of their actions.

In order to find and fix vulnerabilities in systems and networks, penetration testing is a crucial component of an organization's overall security strategy. It should be carried out on a regular basis. Depending on the risk profile of the organisation, the importance of the systems being tested, and regulatory requirements, testing frequency will change. To make sure that vulnerabilities are found and fixed in a timely manner, it should be carried out prior to the implementation of any new systems or networks, before and after any significant changes are made to current systems, and on a regular basis. Additionally, it ought to be carried out in accordance with legal requirements and in response to security incidents or breaches. To strengthen the organization's overall security posture, a regular testing schedule and a strategy for resolving vulnerabilities that are found are essential.




**There are several common scenarios when penetration testing should be conducted:**

1.  New System Implementation: Before a new system or application is put into production, it's crucial to run a penetration test to find and fix any security vulnerabilities. New hardware, software, and network infrastructure are all part of this.
    
2.  Compliance Requirements: Penetration testing is mandated by compliance rules in many industries, such as PCI-DSS for the payment card industry and HIPAA for the healthcare sector. Penetration testing should be performed by organisations subject to these regulations to make sure they are in compliance.
    
3.  Regular Basis: To make sure that the company's security posture is kept up to date and any new vulnerabilities are found as soon as possible, it is advised to conduct regular penetration testing, for example, once a year. Regular testing is also necessary to stay on top of the constantly changing threat landscape.
     
4.  After a significant change in the network or system: Any significant modifications to the software or configuration of the network or system infrastructure may result in the creation of new vulnerabilities. To make sure the system is still secure after any significant changes, it's crucial to run a penetration test.
    
6.  After a security incident: Conducting a penetration test is crucial after a security incident, such as a data breach, to determine the root cause of the incident and to discover any additional vulnerabilities that may have been exploited.
    
7.  Third-party vendor assessment: To make sure that the vendor's systems do not present a risk to the organisation, it is crucial to perform a penetration test on the systems used by the organisation when using a third-party vendor for services like hosting, cloud services, or software development.
    
8.  Mobile Application testing: Since mobile applications are so popular, it's crucial to perform a penetration test on them to make sure they are safe and won't put users' personal information at risk.
    

It's crucial to keep in mind that penetration testing should only be carried out by skilled security professionals who are familiar with the tools and techniques used in ethical hacking. Before beginning the test, they should also obtain permission from the system owner.
