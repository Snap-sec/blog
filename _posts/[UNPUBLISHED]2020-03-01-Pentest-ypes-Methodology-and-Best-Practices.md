## introduction
Penetration testing, also referred to as "pentesting," is a technique for assessing the security of a computer network, web application, or other system by simulating an attack by a malicious actor, or "penetration tester." An attacker could exploit certain weaknesses, and a penetration test's objective is to find them and assess the consequences of such an attack. An essential component of a thorough security programme is penetration testing, which enables organisations to find and fix vulnerabilities before attackers can take advantage of them. Penetration testing can also assist organisations in adhering to rules and industry standards like PCI-DSS and HIPAA. It's important to keep in mind that any penetration testing should be performed by a professional who is knowledgeable about ethical hacking techniques as well as the legal and regulatory requirements for the organisation being tested. Additionally important before starting a penetration test are a risk analysis and a clear understanding of the test's goals.


## Types of penetration testing:

- **Blackbox Penetration Testing:** This type of testing simulates an external attacker who has no prior knowledge of the target's infrastructure, network or system. The tester is only provided with basic information such as the target's IP address or domain name. The objective of blackbox testing is to identify vulnerabilities that an external attacker could exploit.

- **Whitebox Penetration Testing:** This type of testing simulates an internal attacker who has full access and knowledge of the target's infrastructure, network or system. The tester is provided with detailed information such as the target's IP address, domain name, system architecture and access credentials. The objective of whitebox testing is to identify vulnerabilities that an internal attacker could exploit.

- **Greybox Penetration Testing:** This type of testing simulates an attacker who has limited knowledge and access to the target's infrastructure, network or system. The tester is provided with some information about the target such as its IP address, domain name, and some access credentials. The objective of greybox testing is to identify vulnerabilities that an attacker with some level of knowledge about the target could exploit.

It is important to note that all 3 types of penetration testing have the same goal, which is to identify vulnerabilities in a system and to provide recommendations on how to remediate them. The main difference is the level of knowledge and access provided to the tester.


## Subsets and Variations of Penetration Testing


Penetration testing can be used in a variety of ways to assess the security of a system, network, or application. The most typical types include:

- **External Penetration Testing:** This type of testing concentrates on simulating an attack from outside the organization's network by attempting to exploit weaknesses in externally facing systems, like web servers or email servers.

- **Internal penetration testing:** focuses on simulating an attack from within the company's network by typically attempting to exploit weaknesses in internal systems like workstations or servers.

- **Web Application Penetration Testing:** This kind of testing aims to find weaknesses in web applications, like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

- **Wireless Penetration Testing:** This kind of testing is concerned with locating weak points in wireless networks' encryption or access controls.

- **Penetration testing for social engineering:** This kind of testing concentrates on finding weaknesses in an organization's people rather than its technology. It tests employees' susceptibility to phishing, baiting, and pretexting attacks by simulating these types of attacks.

- **Mobile Application Penetration Testing:** This kind of testing focuses on finding flaws in mobile apps, like data leaks or insecure communication.

- **Network Penetration Testing:** This kind of testing aims to find flaws in a network infrastructure, like weak passwords or open ports.

- **Cloud penetration testing:** This kind of testing is aimed at finding flaws in cloud-based systems, such as incorrect configurations or lax access controls.

> It's crucial to keep in mind that different types of penetration testing might be necessary depending on an organization's unique requirements and the systems or networks being tested. A thorough assessment of an organization's security posture may be provided by combining various testing methods.


## Penetration Testing Methodologies:

Penetration testing methodologies can be broken down into three main categories: manual testing, automated testing, and hybrid testing:

1. **Manual testing:** is the process of a human tester manually finding weaknesses in a system. In order to find and exploit vulnerabilities, this type of testing is typically carried out by skilled penetration testers who combine manual methods and tools. When a tester wants to test a particular application or service, for example, manual testing is frequently used.

2. **Automated testing:** The process of automating the detection of system vulnerabilities is known as automated testing. Usually, vulnerability scanning tools from the commercial or open-source world are used for this kind of testing. When a lot of systems need to be tested quickly or when the tester wants to find as many vulnerabilities as possible, automated testing is frequently used.

3. **Hybrid testing:** Combining manual and automated testing is known as hybrid testing. In this kind of testing, vulnerabilities are typically found using automated tools, which are then manually verified and exploited. When the tester wants a deeper understanding of the system's vulnerabilities and security posture, they frequently use this methodology.

1. **Perform a risk assessment:** Prior to beginning a penetration test, it's crucial to perform a risk assessment to determine which networks and systems need to be tested as well as the precise vulnerabilities and threats that need to be addressed.

2. **Establish the scope and objectives:** It's critical to have a clear understanding of the systems and networks that will be tested, the vulnerabilities and threats that will be specifically targeted, as well as the expected results of the penetration test.

3. **Use a methodology:** Using a tried-and-true methodology, like PTES, can help guarantee that the penetration test is carried out methodically and completely.
    
4. **Adhere to ethical standards:** When conducting a penetration test, it's crucial to adhere to ethical standards and legal requirements, such as getting permission from the systems or networks being tested and avoiding causing any harm or disruption to operational systems.

5. **Document and report:** Thorough documentation and reporting are essential for analysing penetration test outcomes and pinpointing potential improvement areas. The systems and networks tested, the vulnerabilities found, and the suggested corrective actions should all be mentioned in the reports.

6. **Keep in mind legal compliance:** It's crucial to keep in mind legal compliance, both in terms of the organization's sector and the nation in which it conducts business. It's critical to comprehend the legal restrictions and confirm that the testing does not contravene any regulations.
    
7. **Regular testing:** It's critical to conduct regular penetration tests to find vulnerabilities and have them quickly fixed. It also helps the organisation stay informed about the current security environment and make the necessary adjustments.

8. **Have a remediation plan in place:** It's crucial to have a remediation plan in place to address any vulnerabilities found during the penetration test. As well as procedures for monitoring the system to make sure it stays secure, this should include steps to patch or mitigate the vulnerability.
    
9. **Keep testing team apart:** To prevent any potential conflicts of interest, it's crucial to keep the testing team apart from the team in charge of the systems being tested.
