The hacker mindset is a way of thinking about the world and your place in it. It is about seeing opportunities for change and innovation everywhere, and then working to make them happen.


This section will teach you how to  build a hackers mindset, and how to think like a hacker.

Hackers will always be weird, sure, some of them might use computers in fun ways or because they are out for science but many find that their nature is so deeply rooted in curiosity that few can even tell what's going on outside themselves and others if it does not concern you. 

Hacking is about breaking into a system and getting the information you want. This can be done in many ways and it is all about finding out what works best for you, your resources and your goals.This mindset is a great way to get creative in the workplace because it allows you to find solutions to problems that are outside of the box. The hacker mindset can be applied to anything, from your career goals to how you approach a project.

Here are top 5 tips by which you can _cultivate a hackers mindset_ to ace in the security industry:

## Learn to programme

Before you set up your hacking tools, It is recommend that you learn to program. Programming skills are helpful, because hunting for bugs or successfull hacking involves many repetitive tasks, and by learning a programming language such as Python or shell scripting, you can automate these tasks to save yourself a lot of time. In addition to that modern web apps are built on using variety of programming languages in both *front end and back end*. A hacker with aim to break into this security must have a crude developer perspective, which will lead him to assumptions of 'What can go wrong?" with this snippet or with this line of code.

 So, to get better at hacking, one should be writing a lot of code! Before one writes code he/she must choose the best programming language for his/her programming. Here is a list of top 10 best programming languages for a beginner <<link top 10 languages blog>>

It is obvious that if one knows the thicks and thins of a system entirely he/she will easily be able to make a plan to break into that system without much fuss and is considerably at a higher probablity of finding a sucessful bug in the system.

You will find many tools and scripts that will read sensitive information of the *applications or targets* for you like *api tokens in javascript files*  or other *misconfiguration in the codes* but you won't find much written about building that insight that will help you to understand the code and detangle its complexity in a fun way.

##  Become a specialist where everyone is generalist

This simply means specialization is key, the generalist is at a disadvantage. There are a few reasons for this. First, the internet has made it easy for people to learn about any topic they're interested in. So there's no need to be a generalist when you can just become an expert in one specific area. 

In order to be a good hacker, you should not just know many skills, technologies and different approaches. You should master one bug, develop one  strong field. In this way, you can be a more efficient and confident hacker in the future. One can have a thorugh understanding of different bugs and various approaches. But to become a successful hacker you must master one single bug  and that will be a game changer for you.

To develop a hacker mindset you should also become a specialist in one vulnerability so that you can direct misdesigns of target into the court where you are a mster. Don't binge learn vulnerabilities like *XSS, SQL injection attacks,  SSRf, BAC etc* like a dabbler who quits after the things get a bit tough. Make a choice and nominate one *attack or vulnerability*  that you are going to master and start digging into that, rather than going from pole to pole without direction.


## Be curious and Research driven

Ask me, What separates hackers from the rest of the world? I would say, it is their research-driven nature. A hacker spends a lot of time researching a vulnerability before they exploit it. This gives them ample opportunity to make more informed decisions about whether or not it’s worth trying their hand at breaking into  system.

Hackers are research driven.  This gives them the chance to know if they can find anything that is exploitable. The reserach is curiosity driven and not for any boring project assigned to you by a professor in the college. A  stereotypical perspective of hackers trying to break into systems for thrills or financial gain are long gone. Most hackers are actually research driven. They're interested in learning about your system and how it works so they can find and exploit any vulnerabilities. And they're succeeding more often by reseraching.

By knowing your target well you are more likely to exploit it than by firing toolls blindly on it. By reseraching your target you get to know it well , its core technologies and features. You go step by step into your target, you reserach more about the *servers  of your target , authentication models, identify more attack surfaces and so on*. Doing an extensive recon  on your target is a triat of a good hacker. 

##  Learn to Stick to things

>“**Patience is not the ability to wait, but the ability to keep a good attitude while waiting**.”


Having patience in hacking is necessary for a hacker. Learn to stick to the target to become a good hacker.  Sticking to one thing or target means you take it seriously and are committed to do what you want. There are barriers in adhering to your target or goal but there is also reward for those who don't show the signs of weariness. One will develop a hacker mindset  only  as the result of lots of repetition and practice. The more reps you put in the more automatic a behavior becomes.

In words of a hacker; "_The essence of being a good hacker is sticking with your target for a long time_.  Mastering is simply sticking with things for the long haul . If you want to be a good hacker don't dabble with many things but stick to a few and reap the reward.

## Bonus tip:

### Find a purpose or reason to work for

Nietzsche said,
 
 > “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”

When you know your purpose, it helps you differentiate between the important and unimportant. When you have the reason and an answer for why you will see dusty path becomming clear and clear. You will be more motivated because now you have a vision and a reason to fight for, you have a reason
