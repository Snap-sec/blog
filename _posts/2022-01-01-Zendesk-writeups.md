Another expedition to choose a new target to hack at snapsec stopped on Zendesk. Zendek was complacent to most of our principles which we consider while choosing a new target to hack. Their available metrics remarked that the *zendesk security team* was responsive and acknowledged the work of security reserachers and pentesters without any bias. The application size was vast and there was hardly any restrictions on scope of testing. The quest began on **Zendesk** and the rest(a mojor part of what we did) will be documented along this blog.


## What the  is zendesk?

Zendesk basically is a comprehensive management platform for all customers and deals within a business. The various functionalities of zendesk product are summarized as below:

{{zendesk pic}}

-   Send an email
-   Fill out a support request form in your Zendesk Support portal
-   Fill out a support request form on your own website
-   Call you on the telephone
-   Text chat with you
-   Send you a Tweet
-   Post on your Facebook wall
- Integrate other platform's data 
- Editable view
- User roles within the organization.
- Customized role segregation.

Zendesk provided various business related services which include **sales, marketplace and other services**. The size of the application was massive and the *implemented functionalities were complex as well*. Implying a lot of things to learn and hack. So, as usual we started with the *product documentation*, *available tutorials*, *youtube channels* and other informative guides. If you are reading to understand a product and to work with it as a normal customer, you are having an unfair advantage on other hackers.

## Our methodology  simpleified:

We have a general methodology by whcih we approach to any target, it covers all from recon to learning intended behaviours and then finally abusing the flow in various forms. Various principles comprising our methodology are as under:

#### 1. Understand the Purpose of the App

At this point the we will try to figure out what is the purpose of app, For example zendesk is used for management of various processes in sales and business. We will learn it and then we will try to emulate the process in the app.



#### 2. Understand the App Logically


At this point we look into several feature separately and try to understand how they have implemented them, For example in zendesk deals we will keep a watch on the *various stages* a deal goes through in the application like *lead, meeting, responses, comments, collaborators* etc.


#### 3. Understand How they do it Technically 

In this phase we  figure out how things work technically for the application. For  Example: what kind of information is being published about deals/contacts in the zendesk. And Do the target app have access control model or any kind of technology like markdown or other stuff.


#### 4. Creating Assumptions 
 
In this phase we create several assumptions about many things in the app, For example if the deal is private to a user can we still send a response via HTTP requests which can change it , can this deal be made public by sending various http request on it. We keep notes  of all of the generated assumption so that we don't miss anything.

#### 5. Attacking The App

 At this point we will use all of our assumptions that can create abnormal behavior in the app, For example can we post comments on the private deals of a user, Can we get the contact details of other users.




## Bypassing CSRF using Cache Deception Attack

Cache deception attack  is often caused by a non-standard server-side setting overriding recommended Cache-Control directives. Due to the cache misconfiguration, an attacker may send a specially crafted link to users, which will result in the leak of sensitive data. In this case we were able to bypass **csrf protection by leveraging the cache decption attack**.

The key component of the attack is "path confusion," which involves altering URL routes to trick the cache server into identifying private HTTP answers as publicly cacheable documents.


For example In Zendesk the URL `https://developer.zendesk.com/account` refers to content containing sensitive data that should not be cached. The attacker tricks the target user into making a request to `https://developer.zendesk.com/account/<Anything>.css` causing the server to respond with response containing sensitive information specific to the victim.
 
 However, the proxy interprets the request to `https://developer.zendesk.com/account/<Anything>.css` as being a request for a non-existent-cacheable '<anything>.css' file, which in turn causes the sensitive content stored in the cache and accessible by others.
 
 Which means an Attacker can trick the victim to visit `https://developer.zendesk.com/account/<Anything>.css` and later visit the same url and to get the cached response of the page which contains name,email and CSRF token of the victim. later, The CSRF TOKEN can be used to perform appilication wide csrf attack.


__Here is a quick Video POC for the vulnerability:__

## Addingremoving tags from restricted contacts,deals and leads

Zendesk Sell is a CRM software focused on empowering sales teams to win more deals. so the main functionality is to generate deals. Deal generation goes through various steps : _from gathering contacts, leads and then the cycle finally end upon deal generation._
So it is in fact a process involving huge sets of data. Zendesk uses the concept of tags to gather a particular data set under a particular tag for ease of management.
The intended behaviour of the application is that a user has read/write access to his tags i,e the tags he owns. So the user can add/remove/modify the tags he has ownership over.
We identified a vulnerable endpoint through which a user was able to get read/write access on the tags created by other users.

- Adding tags to contacts/leads/deals 
```http
POST /apis/tags/api/v1/taggings/batch_add.json

{"tagid":"3","dealid":"231"}
```
- Removing tags from contacts/leads/deals
```http

POST /apis/tags/api/v1/taggings/batch_untag.json

{"tagid":"2"}
```


But we are  able to add/modify/remove the tags of other users that the we are not supposed to be authorised over. This could lead to  quite a chaotic situation as we can add tags on any unauthorised deal or even render a particular data set(contacts/leads/deals) tag less by removing the tags.

## Changing Documents on contacts after admin removes our access to contacts

In Zendesk an admin can invite a user to a limited access role through which the user can view/update/delete and convert their own contacts,leads and deals in their account.
The user can also add documents to his contacts etc.
As the admin has full authority over invited users , the admin can revoke the ownership of the contacts to the invited user. As a result of this the invited user is rendered unable to edit the documents attached to the contacts and the ownership is transferred to the admin.
But we identified a vulnerable endpoint through which we were still able to gain edit access on the documents attached with the contacts even after the admin has revoked our access.

- Editing documents on contacts
```http
PUT /apis/uploader/api/v2/uploads/<upload_id>.json 
```
So we were able to effect the integrity of the documents as we were able to edit the names of documents and even change their extensions.

## Privilege escalations leads to add/remove appointments on restricted contacts.

Since zendesk allows users to collaborate on various functionalities in the app. This was accomplished by various roles for performing different functions in the app. One role in the app was defined as *limitted permission user* which has access to limktted features in the app. The following user was *unable to create* the *contacts* nor could he add any appointments on them.

{{1}}

But we were able to find an api path with *broken access controls*  that lead the **limitted user** to create and remove appointments with the *contacts* eventhough this functionality was restricted from the *said role*.

Limitted user was successfully able to exploit this *api request* to create appointments with the contacts just by using their **contact id**.

```http
POST /apis/appointments/api/v1/appointments.json HTTP/1.1
Host: app.futuresimple.com
Connection: close
Content-Length: 255
x-interaction-id: 3c4eee5f-bda4-4581-bd8d-1e54aeb2ac01

```

The limitted user was able to cancel/delete all of the appointments via below `http request` by changing the **appointment id**.

```http
DELETE /apis/appointments/api/v1/appointments/<<apppointment id>>.json HTTP/1.1
Host: app.futuresimple.com
Connection: close
Content-Length: 12

```
This could lead to *uanuthorized creation of appointments* in an organization and also could have impacted the *integrity and availability  of the contacts and appointments*.

## Exposing restricted documents on private contacts.

As mentioned the permissions restricted the *various roles* from accessing different features on the account. In this case a permission we were testing for was **limitted user permissions** which restricted the assigned user from accessing the *contacts or documents associated with those contacts*. 

This issue lead a user to *access the documents associated with the private contacts of admins*. The admins could associate various documents to their contacts which include *sales scripts, pdf files and other neccessary documents*. 

{{png of douments}}

On analyzing the process we came to conclusion that an http request was responsible for uplaoding a document to any *contact* but the *limitted user was unable to exploit this feature to upload documents on private contacts*. We then changed the *above request method* and appeneded *the contact's id* with the api path and it gave us the *information of the contact in json response*. And in response it leaked the **Public S3 url to access the admin private documents in the json response of this contact**.  We were able to get those *documents without having any permissions on them*.


 ## Unauthorised user is able to leak the sales pipeline and move deals into them


A sales pipeline is a visual illustration of how customers move through the [sales process] stages—from prospecting for leads to making the final sale. It provides valuable insights into each deal, allowing your agents to track their progress, identify any gaps in their process, and form strategies to hit their sales targets.

The admin of the account creates a pipeline and keeps it personal to him without giving any access to the invited user to those pipelines. Admin can move his deals to this pipeline as he controls the ownership of this pipeline.
But we analysed  the following vulnerable request through which we were able to accomplish the task of adding our own deals to admin's pipeline .  

- Moving deals into admins's sales pipeline
```http
PUT /apis/sales/api/v1/deals/<deal-id>.json HTTP/1.1

{"pipeline_stage_id":}
```
So, here due to broken access control on this endpoint we were able to gain an unauthorised access on admin's pipeline allowing us to move our deals into admin's pipeline.





## A simple user in the organisations able to create loss reasons with restricted permissions

When a deal is lost, it is moved into the Lost stage of the sales pipeline. To gain additional information about why this happened, admin can prompt the Sell users to provide a reason for why the deal was lost.This prompt is enabled by a user with admin rights. Admin users can also edit and add other loss reasons.
But we were able to accomplish the task of creating loss reasons inside the organisation via the following api path with broken access control.

- Creating a loss reason
```http
POST /apis/sales/api/v1/loss_reasons.json HTTP/1.1

{"loss_reason":{"name":"My reason"}}
```
